<h3>Data Protection</h3>

<h3>Our Policy For Age Under 18</h3>
<p>The GDPR protects the data of all Europeans by making demands that all sites that accept visitors/customers from European citizens/residents publish and follow a transparent Privacy Policy. We covered the full GDPR requirements in-depth elsewhere. What's important here is what the GDPR says about data subjects who are also minors (under 18).</p>

<p>The GDPR sets a general age of consent at 16, which means you can't legally process the data of a data subject 15 years-old or younger.</p>

<p>In cases where you work with the data of children under 16, you can only process the data with permission from their parent or guardian. Any processing without the consent of an adult with parental responsibility is illegal under EU law.</p>

<p>However, 16 is only the GDPR recommendation. According to Article 8(1), member states may enact laws that lower the age of consent to 13 (but not under 13).</p>
